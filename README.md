# Zerodha Clone (Frontend)

A frontend project created using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React**.

This is an educational project I built while actively learning full-stack web development. To practice and implement my knowledge, I created a clone of Zerodha’s frontend (note: the real website may differ due to updates).  
It has a clean and user-friendly UI.  

The project is deployed on **Vercel** and can be accessed here:
